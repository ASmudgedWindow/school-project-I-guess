        Delaware was founded in 1638 by Peter Minuit as a haven for English Catholics without having to fear persecution. It had warm summers and mild winters, considering it was part of the "Breadbasket" Colonies (Middle Colonies). Delaware was generally a flat lowland with many rivers, making it perfect for trade routes. It also had fertile soil, making it ideal for farming. Delaware was split into three different Counties: New Castle, Kent, and Sussex.
